,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cases are reported when lab tests are completed. This may be a few days after initial testing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Testing capacity is increasing, which is resulting in a greater number of observed cases. There are likely many more cases than currently recorded here. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There may be a small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one positive test result for COVID-19 in Pillar 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are for: NHS trusts and IS providers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"England data captures people admitted to hospital who already had a confirmed COVID-19 status at point of admission, and adds those who tested positive in the previous 24 hours whilst in hospital. Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission are assumed to have been admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wales data includes confirmed and suspected cases, and is the number of admissions to the hospital in the previous 24 hour period up to 9am. The status of COVID/non-COVID is as at the time of reporting not at time of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Northern Ireland data includes suspected and confirmed COVID-19 admissions by admission date. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data for Scotland provides the profile of admissions into hospital for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. The data are published weekly by Public Health Scotland: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This measure includes both Nightingale hospitals and Dragon's Heart/Ysbyty Calon y Ddraig field hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a ventilator bed to be ""available"" this requires more than just the physical bed and ventilator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wales mechanical ventilator beds cover invasive ventilated beds in a critical care setting, plus those outside of a critical care environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scottish figures include people in ICU with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and may include a small number of patients who are not on mechanical ventilation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
England figures include the number of COVID-19 patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Northern Ireland figures include the number of COVID-19 patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are for NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E in England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fluctuations in the North West have been driven by data validation changes and missing trusts returning data (creating artificial spikes in reporting.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nine hospitals, including London Nightingale did not return data for April 9, resulting in a misrepresented drop in hospitalisations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National data may not be directly comparable as data about COVID-19 patients in hospitals is collected differently across nations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Community hospitals are included in figures for Wales from 23 April onwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
England and Scotland data includes 'confirmed' COVID-19 cases; Wales and Northern Ireland data includes ‘confirmed’ and ‘suspected’ COVID-19 cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to the way Northern Ireland report, the UK figure is calculated by taking the most recent day for Great Britain plus the previous day for Northern Ireland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 22nd May, a change in reporting resulted in some patients in Wales being reclassified as COVID patients. Prior to this date, some COVID positive patients who had been in hospital for 14 days and recovered were reported as non COVID patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Northern Ireland data were revised on 30 May to reflect a methodology change for calculating the number of COVID inpatients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
